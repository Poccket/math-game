Simulation of three tests to verify the solution to the Monty Hall problem.
The problem is such:

* Player 1 has three doors, behind one of which is a prize, the other two, nothing (or goats)
* Player 2 may pick any door of the set
* Player 1 will reveal one of the two doors that has not been picked, that contains a goat
* Player 2 may switch their door from the picked door, to the door that was not opened
* Player 1 reveals the selected door and whether or not Player 2 made the correct choices

The problem being if it's more profitable to switch the door or not.
The program I wrote tests three strategies:
1. Always saying 'Yes'
2. Always saying 'No'
3. Randomly saying 'Yes' or 'No'

The winrate of each is determined as a percentage
Winrates will be logged to the console
And unlike /numberphile/ I won't be making logs because they take too much space
