# math-game

Crappy bash programs to test math solutions or problems a few thousand times.
So far we have:

* ![Monty Hall Problem](https://github.com/Poccket/math-game/tree/master/montyhall)
* ![Math Game](https://github.com/Poccket/math-game/blob/master/numberphile)

If anyone knows the name of "Math Game" lemme know.
