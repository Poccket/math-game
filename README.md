  1. Player 1 picks two numbers within a range (Hereafter referred to as A and B)  
  2. Player 1 reveals A to Player 2  
  3. Player 2 must guess whether A is bigger or smaller than B

- 'montyhall'

  This one is a game based off the Monty Hall problem, and is played as follows:
  1. Player 1 has three doors, behind one of which is a prize, the other two, nothing (or goats)  
  2. Player 2 may pick any door of the set    
  3. Player 1 will reveal one of the two doors that has not been picked, that contains a goat  
  4. Player 2 may switch their door from the picked door, to the door that was not opened  
  5. Player 1 reveals the selected door and whether or not Player 2 made the correct choices

- 'binary-count'
  
  A simple guessing game, binary count being the fastest way to win. It is played as follows:

  1. Player 1 picks a number within a range (Hereafter reffered to as A)  
  2. Player 2 guesses A, if correct end the game here.  
  3. If incorrect, Player 1 states whether it's higher or lower than A  
  4. Players repeat steps 2 and 3 until game end.
