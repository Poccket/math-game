# math-game - python/binary-count

[binary-count.py](https://github.com/Poccket/math-game/blob/master/python/binary-count/binary-count.py) works for Python 2.7 AND Python 3.5! But if you decide to use the exclusive versions, make sure you're using the right one!

* binary-count3-5.py is for Python 3.5!
* binary-count2-7.py is for Python 2.7!

If you don't, it won't work!
